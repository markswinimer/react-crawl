### React Crawl ###
React Crawl is a project I created to experiment with game design in React. 
This is the second quick iteration of this idea.

### Concept / Purpose ###
The eventual idea for react crawl is to be loosely based off of roguelike dungeon crawl games. You are mining through different types of minerals which each have their own time value it takes to mine. The varying minerals and durations are represented here with colors


### Challenges / What I've Learned so far ###
I am discovering a lot of the limitations when working with state. Using a library like Redux seems almost neccesary. Redux is high on my list of libraries to master, with alternatives being a consideration. 

Randomization is a very algorithm heavy. Even the most rudimentary randomization can still be tough to wrap my head around at times. It has been a fun challenge.
